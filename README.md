Here’s a tailored **README.md** for your Expo Weather App that explains setup, usage, and how the app works:

---

# 🌦️ Weather App (Expo)

A simple weather application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.
Users can enter a **city name** to fetch and display real-time weather data using a weather API.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Search for weather by city name
* Displays temperature, weather condition, and additional details
* Clean and minimal UI

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can run the app on:

* **Expo Go** (scan QR code)

---

## 🔑 API Setup

This app uses a weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)).

1. Create a free account and get your **API key**.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

   ```env
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. In your code, load the key with [expo-constants](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/) or [react-native-dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv).
